# Telecom KPI Dashboards – Tableau Capstone Project

## Disclaimer
This project is made up for educational purposes as part of the Data Science Bootcamp. The datasets and tasks are designed to test the ability to visualize data effectively and communicate analytical insights.

---

## Project Overview
This capstone project includes **two main tasks** focused on Telecom performance:

1. **Performance Analysis** – Create dynamic dashboards for weekly and daily KPI performance.  
2. **Voice Revenue Analysis** – Analyze voice revenue decline and factors affecting subscriber usage.

The goal is to showcase Tableau skills in creating user-friendly, interactive dashboards with meaningful visualizations.

## Datasets

1. **Daily revenue & subscriber data** – Excel workbook containing revenues and subscriber counts per tariff.  
2. **Voice usage history** – Excel workbook with anonymized subscriber data for 4 months.

## Task 1: Performance Analysis

**Objectives:**
- Build dashboards analyzing KPIs: Total Revenue, Minutes of Usage, On-net Minutes, Off-net Minutes, MB of usage.  
- Use parameters to allow dynamic selection of KPIs.  
- Calculate per-subscriber averages:
  - Average Revenue per Subscriber = Total Revenue / Number of Subscribers
  - Average Voice/Data/On-net/Off-net Revenue per Subscriber  
- Display top 5 tariffs per KPI with growth rates and performance analysis.  
- Visualize revenue proportions, clusters, and trends.

**Deliverables:**
- 1 Tableau Desktop file (.twb) with 2 dashboards  
- Text document answering specific analysis questions

**Key Questions to Answer:**
1. Which tariff has the highest revenue in January 2020?  
2. Which tariff has the highest data revenue growth last month?  
3. For which tariff is data revenue higher than other types of revenue?

## Task 2: Voice Revenue Analysis

**Objectives:**
- Explore decline in total voice duration.  
- Identify factors associated with voice usage decrease:  
  - Subscribers with higher MB usage  
  - Subscribers with higher revenue  
  - Subscribers with higher minutes of usage  
- Analyze top 10 tariffs by voice revenue and their usage decline.  
- Examine patterns for tariffs with >50% voice duration decline.

**Deliverables:**
- 1 Tableau Desktop file (.twb) with 2 dashboards  
- Answer questions directly on the dashboards
